Project Folder:
The project takes the contents of two text files, carddata2 and transactiondata2.
Each card class and transaction class file are used to take in the file and read its content, creating cards (debit, rewards, or prepaid) with the card holder name, ID number, and expiration. It then reads the transactions made on each one, listing the purchases made and its amount spent on said card.
Files carddata2.txt and transactiondata2.txt are used.
